# PawsTech Smart Pet Devices Analysis Report
#### A Data Visualization Project by Udacity

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
You serve as a business intelligence analyst at PawsTech, a leader in smart pet devices. Following the success of PawTrack, a revolutionary fitness collar for dogs, PawsTech is exploring a similar product for cats—PawPurr. Despite the triumph with dogs, there are uncertainties about its adaptation for cats. Consequently, the product team has field-tested 1,000 PawPurr prototypes. Your task is to develop a comprehensive Power BI report to compare the collected data with that from the PawTrack devices, providing insights that will influence the executive decision on whether to proceed with PawPurr's full-scale launch.

## BUSINESS REQUESTS
+ The CEO has posed critical questions for this report:
  * Have cats wearing PawPurr increased their average daily steps as dogs did with PawTrack?
  * Do PawPurr owners report the same level of satisfaction as PawTrack owners?
+ The Chief Marketing Officer insists that the report maintains brand consistency by incorporating only PawsTech’s color palette, logo, and other approved visual elements.
+ The product team values insights on demographic differences between the pet owners and detailed information about their households. They recommend using advanced slicers for dynamic data exploration in the report.

## PROJECT STEPS
1. Analyze the provided data model and business queries to identify relevant metrics.
2. Design and implement visualizations that answer the CEO’s questions, specifically focusing on the average daily steps and user satisfaction.
3. Integrate demographic insights using varied visuals like bar charts, line charts, and more.
4. Organize the report to highlight crucial findings, with key insights upfront followed by detailed demographic analysis.
5. Adhere to the branding guidelines specified by the Chief Marketing Officer throughout the visual presentation.

## KEY FEATURES
+ **Bookmarks and Drill-throughs:** Use bookmarks to switch visuals dynamically and drill-through capabilities for detailed data exploration.
+ **Interactive Elements:** Include various slicers and navigation buttons to enhance user interaction and ease of report navigation.

## DRILL-THROUGH FEATURES
Implemented drill-through functionality focuses on specific entities such as pet types or demographic segments, allowing detailed examination within the context of the broader dataset.

## PAGE NAVIGATION
Ease of navigation is ensured through strategically placed buttons across the report pages, enhancing the user experience with hover effects that indicate their functionality.

## INSIGHTS
The initial analysis suggests that:
+ PawPurr may not match PawTrack in terms of step increases or owner satisfaction.
+ The demographic and behavioral data provide essential insights into potential market segments and user preferences.

## Conclusion
Your feedback is crucial as we continue to refine our approach to meet the needs of pet owners and enhance our product offerings.
