# 🐾 PawsTech Smart Pet Devices Analysis Report
#### 📘 A Data Visualization Project by Udacity

## 📊 PROJECT OVERVIEW
🐶 PawsTech's PawTrack, a dog fitness collar, has experienced significant success, prompting interest in developing a similar product for cats. To assess the feasibility of this venture, the product team conducted field testing of 1,000 PawPurr prototypes. The data collected was analyzed to address key questions the CEO posed and provide insights for decision-making.

🐱 Following the success of PawTrack, a revolutionary fitness collar for dogs, PawsTech is exploring a similar product for cats—PawPurr. Despite the triumph with dogs, there are uncertainties about its adaptation for cats. Consequently, the product team has field-tested 1,000 PawPurr prototypes. Our task was to develop a comprehensive Power BI report to compare the collected data with that from the PawTrack devices, providing insights that will influence the executive decision on whether to proceed with PawPurr's full-scale launch.

## 📑 BUSINESS REQUESTS
+ 🏢 The CEO has posed critical questions that should be answered:
  * Have cats wearing PawPurr increased their average daily steps as dogs did with PawTrack?
  * Do PawPurr owners report the same level of satisfaction as PawTrack owners?
+ 📊 The product team values insights on demographic differences between the pet owners and detailed information about their households. In the report, they recommend using advanced slicers for dynamic data exploration.

## ✅ PROJECT STEPS
 *✅ 1. Analyze the provided data model and business queries to identify relevant metrics.
 *✅ 2. Design and implement visualizations that answer the CEO’s questions, specifically focusing on the average daily steps and user satisfaction.
 *✅ 3. Integrate demographic insights using varied visuals like bar charts and line charts.
 *✅ 4. Organize the report to highlight crucial findings, with key insights upfront, followed by detailed demographic analysis.
 *✅ 5. Adhere to the branding guidelines the Chief Marketing Officer specified throughout the visual presentation.
## 🗂️ ORGANIZING THE REPORT
### The report is organized according to the following guidelines:
  * 📄 The first page should highlight the CEO’s business questions, specifically calling out the differences in average step count and average user rating (if any) between PawTrack and PawPurr devices.
  * 🐾 The second page should focus on insights related to pets using the device.
  * 👨‍👩‍👦 The third page should focus on insights related to the families that own the pets.
